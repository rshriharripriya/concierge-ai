=== DOCUMENT 1: F-1 Student Tax Guide - Nonresident Alien Status ===
TITLE: F-1 Student Tax Filing Requirements and Exemptions
SOURCE: IRS Publication 519, Sprintax
CATEGORY: tax

F-1 visa holders are typically considered nonresident aliens for tax purposes during their first 5 calendar years in the United States.

Tax Residency Test for F-1 Students:
F-1 students are EXEMPT from the Substantial Presence Test for the first 5 calendar years in the U.S. This means you are generally a nonresident alien for tax purposes during this period, regardless of how many days you were physically present.

After 5 calendar years, you must use the Substantial Presence Test:
- Count days in current year × 1
- Count days in prior year × 1/3
- Count days in year before that × 1/6
- If total ≥ 183 days AND you were in U.S. 31+ days this year, you become a resident alien

Tax Forms Required:
1. Form 8843 (Statement for Exempt Individuals) - REQUIRED even if you had NO income
   - Due date: April 15 (or June 15 if no U.S. withholding)
   - Lists days present in U.S. and visa status
   - Required for F-1, F-2, J-1, J-2 visa holders

2. Form 1040-NR (Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return) - if you had ANY U.S. income
   - Report wages, scholarships, fellowships, grants
   - Report interest income from U.S. banks
   - Report any other U.S. source income

3. State Tax Return - varies by state
   - Check if your state requires nonresident filing
   - Nine states have no income tax: AK, FL, NV, NH, SD, TN, TX, WA, WY

Income Tax Rates for F-1 Students (2024 Tax Year):
Nonresident aliens use different tax tables:
- $0 to $11,600: 10%
- $11,601 to $47,150: 12%
- $47,151 to $100,525: 22%
- $100,526 to $191,950: 24%

- $243,726 to $609,350: 35%
- $609,351 or more: 37%

IMPORTANT: Nonresident aliens cannot use standard deduction. You can only claim itemized deductions if you qualify under specific treaty provisions.

FICA Tax Exemption:
F-1 students are EXEMPT from Social Security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%) taxes on:
- On-campus employment
- CPT (Curricular Practical Training)
- OPT (Optional Practical Training)
- STEM OPT Extension

This exemption applies for your first 5 calendar years in F-1 status. After 5 years, if you become a resident alien, you MUST pay FICA taxes.

If your employer incorrectly withheld FICA taxes:
1. Request refund from employer first (Form 843 and Form 8316)
2. If employer refuses, file claim with IRS using Form 843
3. Attach evidence: I-20, visa, I-94, employment authorization
4. You can claim refunds for up to 3 years back

Scholarship and Fellowship Taxation:
- Qualified scholarships (tuition, fees, books): Tax-free
- Non-qualified scholarships (room, board, travel): Taxable at 14% withholding rate
- Fellowships for services rendered: Taxable as wages
- Report on Form 1040-NR, line 1b (scholarship income)

Tax Treaties:
Many countries have tax treaties with the U.S. that provide additional benefits:
- China (PRC): Article 20 - $5,000 exemption for students
- India: Article 21 - Payments from abroad for maintenance/education are exempt
- Canada: Article XX - Students exempt on certain grants
- South Korea: Article 21 - Payments from abroad exempt
- Check IRS Publication 901 for your country's treaty

To claim treaty benefits:
1. File Form W-8BEN with your employer/payer
2. Claim treaty exemption on Form 1040-NR, line 22
3. Attach Form 8833 if claiming treaty position that reduces withholding

=== DOCUMENT 3: H-1B Visa Tax Filing Guide ===
TITLE: H-1B Visa Holder Tax Obligations and Filing Requirements
SOURCE: IRS Publication 519, H-1B Expert
CATEGORY: tax

H-1B visa holders have different tax treatment than F-1 students because H-1B is a dual-intent visa allowing immigrant intent.

Tax Residency Status:
Unlike F-1 students, H-1B workers are NOT exempt from the Substantial Presence Test. Most H-1B holders become resident aliens for tax purposes in their first year in the U.S.

Substantial Presence Test:
You are a resident alien if:
- You were in the U.S. for 31+ days during current year, AND
- Sum of days present = 183 or more using this formula:
  * All days in current year × 1
  * Days in prior year × 1/3
  * Days in year before × 1/6

Example:
2024: 300 days
2023: 120 days
2022: 60 days
Calculation: (300 × 1) + (120 × 1/3) + (60 × 1/6) = 300 + 40 + 10 = 350 days
Result: Resident alien for 2024

Filing as Resident Alien (Most H-1B Holders):
Form 1040 (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return)
- Report worldwide income (U.S. and foreign)
- Claim standard deduction ($14,600 single, $29,200 married filing jointly in 2024)

Dual-Status Year (Common First Year):
If you arrive mid-year, you're a dual-status taxpayer:
- Nonresident for days before meeting Substantial Presence Test
- Resident for days after
- File Form 1040 with statement: "Dual-Status Return"
- Attach Form 1040-NR for nonresident portion
- Pro-rate standard deduction based on resident months

Choosing Resident Status (First-Year Choice):
If you're a nonresident for most of the year but will be a resident next year, you can elect to be treated as a resident for the entire year:

- Attach statement making the election
- Benefit: Can use standard deduction and joint filing rates
- Drawback: Must report worldwide income for entire year

FICA Taxes for H-1B:

- If you skip this, you may have trouble getting future U.S. visas

Extensions and Amendments:
- File Form 4868 for automatic 6-month extension (October 15)
- Extensions give time to file, NOT time to pay (pay by April 15 to avoid penalties)

=== DOCUMENT 5: Nonresident Alien Investment Taxation - Stocks and Bonds ===
TITLE: How International Students and Visa Holders Pay Taxes on Stock Investments
SOURCE: IRS Publication 519, IRC Section 871
CATEGORY: tax

Nonresident aliens (F-1, J-1, H-1B in first year, etc.) have special rules for investment income and capital gains.

U.S. Stocks - Dividends:
Dividends from U.S. corporations are subject to 30% withholding tax:
- Withholding is automatic (broker withholds before payment)
- Reported on Form 1099-DIV (or Form 1042-S for foreign brokers)
- Report on Form 1040-NR, line 3 (dividend income)
- Tax treaties may reduce rate (e.g., Canada 15%, UK 15%, India 25%)

Qualified vs. Ordinary Dividends:
For nonresident aliens, there is NO distinction:
- All dividends taxed at 30% (or treaty rate)
- The "qualified dividend" preference (15% rate) only applies to resident aliens and citizens

U.S. Stocks - Capital Gains:
CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT TAXED if:
- You are a nonresident alien
- You were present in the U.S. less than 183 days during the tax year
- Gain is not "effectively connected" with U.S. trade or business

This means:
- Buy U.S. stocks, hold, sell for profit = NO U.S. TAX on the gain
- No reporting required on Form 1040-NR for exempt capital gains
- Your home country may tax the gain (check local laws)

Exception - 183-Day Rule:
If you were in the U.S. for 183+ days during the tax year:
- Capital gains taxed at 30% flat rate (no deductions allowed)
- Report on Form 1040-NR, Schedule NEC (Tax on Income Not Effectively Connected)
- This rarely applies to F-1 students (usually under 183 days)

Foreign Stocks:
- Dividends from foreign corporations: Generally not subject to U.S. tax
- Capital gains on foreign stocks: Not subject to U.S. tax
- Exception: If effectively connected with U.S. business
- Your home country likely taxes these (check tax treaty)

Interest Income:
Bank Interest:
- Interest from U.S. banks: EXEMPT from U.S. tax for nonresident aliens
- No withholding, no reporting required
- Report on Form 1040-NR, line 2a (shows as exempt income)

Bond Interest:
- U.S. Treasury bonds: EXEMPT from U.S. tax
- Corporate bonds: Subject to 30% withholding (or treaty rate)
- Municipal bonds: EXEMPT from federal tax (and often state tax)

Investment Platforms for Nonresident Aliens:
Not all brokers accept nonresident alien customers:
- Fidelity: Yes (with restrictions)
- Charles Schwab: Yes (International Account)
- Interactive Brokers: Yes (excellent for NRAs)
- TD Ameritrade: Yes
- Robinhood: NO (requires SSN and U.S. residency)
- Webull: YES (allows NRAs with passport)

Opening Brokerage Account as NRA:
Required documents:
- Passport (government-issued ID)
- Visa documents (I-20, I-94, DS-2019)
- U.S. address (can use university or current residence)
- Foreign address (permanent home address)
- Form W-8BEN (Certificate of Foreign Status)

Form W-8BEN:
Certifies you are a foreign person (not subject to backup withholding):
- Part I: Name, country of citizenship, permanent address
- Part II: Treaty claims (if applicable)
- Part III: Certification (sign and date)
- Valid for 3 years (must renew)
- Failure to provide = 30% withholding on ALL payments

Tax Reporting:
Form 1040-NR Reporting:
- Line 2a: Interest income (usually exempt, shown for information)
- Line 3: Dividend income (after 30% withholding)
- Schedule NEC: Capital gains IF 183+ days in U.S.

No Need to Report:
- Capital gains if under 183 days (exempt)
- Exempt interest income (informational only)

Brokerage Tax Documents:
- Form 1099-DIV: Dividends (if U.S. broker)
- Form 1099-INT: Interest income
- Form 1099-B: Proceeds from sales (shows gross, not taxable gain)
- Form 1042-S: If foreign broker or treaty withholding applied

Tax Treaty Benefits:
To reduce dividend withholding rate:
- File Form W-8BEN with broker
- Claim treaty country and article
- Examples:
  * Canada: Article XI reduces dividends to 15%
  * UK: Article 10 reduces to 15%
  * Germany: Article 10 reduces to 15%
  * Japan: Article 10 reduces to 10%
  * India: Article 10 reduces to 25%

State Taxation:
Most states do not tax investment income of nonresident aliens unless:
- You have a state tax filing requirement for other reasons (wages)
- Income is allocated to that state
Check your state's rules.

Switching from Nonresident to Resident Alien:
Once you become a resident alien (after 5 years, or meet Substantial Presence Test):
- Dividends: Now taxed at qualified dividend rates (0%, 15%, 20%)
- Capital gains: Short-term (ordinary rates), long-term (0%, 15%, 20%)
- Must report ALL worldwide investment income
- Can offset gains with losses
- Much more favorable tax treatment

Retirement Accounts (IRA, 401k):
Nonresident aliens CAN contribute to:
- 401(k) if employer offers (and you have wages)
- Traditional IRA if you have earned income

Contribution limits same as residents:
- 401(k): $23,000 (2024)
- IRA: $7,000 (2024)

Tax treatment:
- Contributions reduce current taxable income
- Earnings grow tax-deferred
- Withdrawals taxed when taken (30% withholding for NRAs)

Special considerations:
- If you leave U.S. permanently, early withdrawal penalties may apply
- Some tax treaties reduce withholding on retirement distributions
- Consider Roth IRA if you'll become resident alien (tax-free growth)

Investment Losses:
Nonresident aliens CANNOT deduct capital losses:
- No offsetting gains with losses
- No $3,000 annual capital loss deduction
- Losses cannot be carried forward

This changes once you become a resident alien.

Cryptocurrency - see separate document for detailed crypto rules.

=== DOCUMENT 6: Cryptocurrency Taxation for Nonresident Aliens ===
TITLE: F-1, H-1B, and Nonresident Alien Cryptocurrency Tax Rules
SOURCE: IRS Notice 2014-21, Rev Rul 2023-14
CATEGORY: tax

The IRS treats cryptocurrency as property. For nonresident aliens, crypto taxation follows investment property rules but with important differences.

Cryptocurrency Capital Gains - Nonresident Aliens:
If you are a nonresident alien AND present in U.S. less than 183 days in the tax year:
- Cryptocurrency gains are EXEMPT from U.S. federal income tax
- No need to report gains on Form 1040-NR
- This applies to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all other cryptocurrencies
- Your home country may tax the gains (check local laws)

Exception - 183-Day Presence:
If you were in the U.S. for 183+ days in the tax year:
- All crypto gains taxed at flat 30% rate
- Report on Form 1040-NR, Schedule NEC
- No deductions for losses allowed
- No offset of gains with losses

Cryptocurrency Trading:
Each trade is a taxable event (if 183+ day rule applies):
- Selling crypto for USD: Taxable
- Trading Bitcoin for Ethereum: Taxable
- Using crypto to buy goods/services: Taxable
- Holding crypto: Not taxable

Cost Basis Calculation:
- Original purchase price + fees = cost basis
- Sale price - cost basis = capital gain or loss
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is default method
- Can elect specific identification if you track it

Example (Under 183 Days - NO TAX):
- Buy 1 BTC for $30,000 in March
- Sell for $50,000 in November
- Present in U.S.: 120 days
- Capital gain: $20,000
- U.S. tax owed: $0 (exempt)

Example (Over 183 Days - TAXED):
- Same transaction
- Present in U.S.: 200 days
- Capital gain: $20,000
- U.S. tax owed: $6,000 (30%)

Cryptocurrency Mining:
If you mine cryptocurrency:
- Fair market value at time of receipt is ordinary income
- Taxed at normal income tax rates (10%-37%)
- Report on Form 1040-NR, line 8 (Other income)
- May also owe self-employment tax if business activity (15.3%)

When you later sell mined coins:
- Cost basis = fair market value when received
- Calculate capital gain/loss from that basis
- Subject to 183-day rule

Example:
- Mine 0.5 BTC when Bitcoin = $40,000
- Income: $20,000 (taxable immediately)
- Tax on mining: $20,000 × your tax bracket
- Later sell for $50,000
- Cost basis: $20,000
- Capital gain: $30,000 (exempt if under 183 days)

Cryptocurrency Staking:
Staking rewards are treated like mining:
- Income when received (fair market value)
- Report as ordinary income
- Taxed in year received, not when sold

Example:
- Stake Ethereum, receive 0.1 ETH reward
- ETH price when received: $2,000
- Income: $200 (taxable)
- Report on Form 1040-NR, line 8

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens):
NFTs are treated as property (same as cryptocurrency):
- Gains on sales subject to capital gains rules
- 183-day rule applies
- Creating and selling NFTs may be business income

Cryptocurrency on Foreign Exchanges:
If you use a foreign cryptocurrency exchange (Binance, Kraken International, etc.):
- Same U.S. tax rules apply
- Still subject to 183-day rule
- May receive Form 1042-S instead of 1099-B
- Report on Form 1040-NR if required

U.S. Cryptocurrency Exchanges:
Most U.S. exchanges accept nonresident aliens:
- Coinbase: Yes (with passport and visa)
- Kraken: Yes
- Gemini: Yes
- Binance US: Generally no (requires SSN)

Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR):
If your cryptocurrency is held on an exchange (not self-custody wallet):
- Some argue exchange accounts are "foreign accounts"
- FBAR required if total foreign accounts > $10,000 at any time
- File FinCEN Form 114 by April 15
- Penalties for non-filing are severe ($10,000+)

Note: FBAR rules for crypto are still evolving. IRS has not issued final guidance.

FATCA Reporting:
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act:
- Form 8938 required if foreign assets > threshold
- Single: $200,000 on last day OR $300,000 at any time
- Married: $400,000 on last day OR $600,000 at any time
- Cryptocurrency on foreign exchanges MAY be reportable
- File with Form 1040-NR

Becoming a Resident Alien - Tax Impact:
Once you become a resident alien for tax purposes:
- All crypto gains taxed (no 183-day exemption)
- Short-term gains (≤1 year): Ordinary income rates (10%-37%)
- Long-term gains (>1 year): Preferential rates (0%, 15%, 20%)
- Can offset gains with losses
- Can deduct up to $3,000 in net losses per year
- Wash sale rules do NOT apply to crypto (can sell and rebuy immediately)

Crypto Tax Software:
Recommended for tracking transactions:
- CoinTracker
- Koinly
- TaxBit
- CryptoTrader.Tax
- ZenLedger

These integrate with exchanges and calculate gains/losses automatically.

Record Keeping:
Keep records of ALL cryptocurrency transactions:
- Date of acquisition
- Cost basis (amount paid + fees)
- Date of sale/trade
- Fair market value at sale
- Purpose of transaction
- Exchange records
- Wallet addresses

Retain records for at least 6 years (IRS audit period for substantial underreporting).

DeFi (Decentralized Finance):
Complex tax issues:
- Liquidity pool rewards: Likely ordinary income
- Yield farming: Income when received
- Swapping tokens on DEX: Taxable event
- Airdrops: Income at fair market value when received
- Gas fees: Add to cost basis or treat as separate expense

IRS has not issued detailed DeFi guidance yet. Consult tax professional for complex DeFi activities.

Selling at a Loss:
If you sell crypto at a loss as a nonresident alien:
- Cannot deduct the loss
- Cannot offset gains from other transactions
- Cannot carry loss forward

This is a major disadvantage compared to resident aliens.

State Taxation:
Most states do not tax crypto gains for nonresident aliens unless:
- You have state filing requirement for other income
- State specifically taxes nonresident investment income (rare)

Leaving the U.S.:
If you leave U.S. permanently while holding crypto:
- No exit tax on unrealized crypto gains (unless you're a covered expatriate - very rare)
- Future gains after departure not subject to U.S. tax
- Your home country will tax gains (check local rules)

Tax Treaty Benefits:
Most tax treaties do NOT address cryptocurrency specifically:
- Treated as capital gains under most treaties

IRS Enforcement:
The IRS is actively pursuing crypto tax enforcement:
- Exchanges must report to IRS (Form 1099-B starting 2025)
- IRS uses blockchain analysis tools
- Form 1040 asks: "At any time during 2024, did you receive, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of any financial interest in virtual currency?"
- Penalties for failure to report can be substantial
