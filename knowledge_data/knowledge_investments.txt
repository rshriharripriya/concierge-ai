Stocks represent ownership in corporations. When you buy stocks, you become a shareholder.

Types of Stocks:
1. Common Stock - voting rights, dividends (if company pays them), capital appreciation
2. Preferred Stock - fixed dividends, priority over common stock, usually no voting rights

How to Buy Stocks:
- Brokerage account (Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E*TRADE, Robinhood, etc.)
- Direct stock purchase plans (DSPPs)
- Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs)
- Retirement accounts (401k, IRA)

Stock Transactions and Tax Events:
1. BUYING stocks - NOT a taxable event
2. HOLDING stocks - NOT taxable (unrealized gains)
3. SELLING stocks - TAXABLE (realized gains or losses)
4. RECEIVING dividends - TAXABLE

Capital Gains Tax Rates (U.S. Residents):
Short-Term Capital Gains (held ≤1 year):
- Taxed as ordinary income (10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, 37%)
- Added to your wages and other income
- Higher tax burden than long-term

Long-Term Capital Gains (held >1 year):
- 0% rate if taxable income under $47,025 (single) or $94,050 (married filing jointly) in 2024
- 15% rate if income between those amounts and $518,900/$583,750
- 20% rate if income above those thresholds

Example:
Bought 100 shares of Apple at $150 = $15,000
Sold 100 shares at $200 = $20,000
Gain: $5,000

If held 6 months (short-term):
- Gain taxed at your ordinary income rate (e.g., 22% = $1,100 tax)

If held 14 months (long-term):
- Gain taxed at preferential rate (e.g., 15% = $750 tax)

Dividend Taxation:
Ordinary Dividends:
- Taxed at ordinary income rates (10%-37%)
- Reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 1a

Qualified Dividends:
- Taxed at capital gains rates (0%, 15%, 20%)
- Must meet holding period (61 days during 121-day period around ex-dividend date)
- Must be from U.S. corporation or qualified foreign corporation
- Reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 1b

Dividend Example:
Received $1,000 in qualified dividends
- If income puts you in 15% long-term capital gains bracket
- Tax owed: $150
- If ordinary dividends at 24% bracket: $240

Cost Basis Tracking:
Cost basis = original purchase price + commissions/fees

Methods for calculating basis when selling:
1. Specific Identification - choose which shares to sell (best for tax management)
2. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) - sell oldest shares first (default)
3. Average Cost - average price of all shares (mutual funds only)

Example - Specific Identification:
Bought 10 shares at $100 (March)
Bought 10 shares at $150 (June)
Current price: $200

Selling 10 shares:
- Sell June shares (higher basis): Gain = $500
- Sell March shares (lower basis): Gain = $1,000
Choose June shares to minimize taxes!

Wash Sale Rule:
If you sell stock at a loss and buy substantially identical stock within 30 days before or after:
- Loss is DISALLOWED for current year
- Disallowed loss added to basis of new shares
- Affects tax timing, not total tax owed

Example:
Sell 100 shares Apple at $5,000 loss (Dec 1)
Buy 100 shares Apple (Dec 15)
- Cannot deduct $5,000 loss in current year
- Loss added to basis of new shares
- Deferred until you sell new shares

To avoid: Wait 31+ days before repurchasing, or buy similar but not identical stock (e.g., sell Apple, buy Microsoft)

Stock Splits:
When company splits stock (e.g., 2-for-1):
- Number of shares doubles
- Price per share halves
- Total value unchanged
- NOT a taxable event
- Adjust cost basis accordingly

Example:
Owned 100 shares at $200/share (cost basis: $20,000)
2-for-1 split
Now own 200 shares at $100/share (cost basis still: $20,000)
New cost basis per share: $100

Stock Dividends:
Non-taxable stock dividends:
- Receive additional shares instead of cash
- NOT taxable when received
- Adjust cost basis (spread over more shares)
- Taxable when you sell shares

Taxable stock dividends:
- Option to receive cash or stock
- Taxable as dividends even if you choose stock

Reporting Stock Sales:
Form 8949 - Sales and Dispositions of Capital Assets:
- Part I: Short-term transactions
- Part II: Long-term transactions
- List each sale (date acquired, date sold, proceeds, cost basis, gain/loss)

Schedule D - Capital Gains and Losses:
- Summarizes Form 8949 totals
- Calculates net short-term and long-term gains/losses
- Carries to Form 1040, line 7

Form 1099-B:
Broker reports:
- Sale proceeds
- Cost basis (if broker tracked it)
- Holding period (short-term or long-term)
- Wash sale adjustments

Capital Loss Deductions:
You can offset capital gains with capital losses:
- Short-term losses offset short-term gains first
- Long-term losses offset long-term gains first
- Net loss up to $3,000 can offset ordinary income
- Remaining losses carry forward indefinitely

Example:
$10,000 long-term gain (stocks)
$4,000 long-term loss (stocks)
Net: $6,000 gain (taxable)

Or:
$2,000 gain
$8,000 loss
Net: $6,000 loss
- Deduct $3,000 this year (offset ordinary income)
- Carry forward $3,000 to next year

Investment Expenses:
Previously deductible (pre-2018):
- Investment advisory fees
- Subscription services
- Safe deposit box fees

Currently NOT deductible (2018-2025):
- Tax reform suspended these deductions
- May return in 2026

Still deductible:
- Interest paid on margin loans (up to net investment income)

Retirement Accounts:
401(k), IRA, Roth IRA stock investments:
- NO capital gains tax while in account
- Gains grow tax-free (Roth) or tax-deferred (Traditional)
- Traditional: Withdrawals taxed as ordinary income
- Roth: Qualified withdrawals completely tax-free
- No Form 8949 needed for trades within retirement accounts

Tax-Loss Harvesting:
Strategy to minimize taxes:
1. Sell stocks with losses before year-end
2. Offset gains from winning stocks
3. Deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income
4. Carry forward remaining losses
5. Avoid wash sale rule (wait 31 days to repurchase)

Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT):
Additional 3.8% tax on investment income if:
- Modified AGI exceeds $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing jointly)
- Applies to interest, dividends, capital gains
- In addition to regular capital gains tax

Example:
$300,000 income (single)
$50,000 long-term capital gains
- Regular capital gains tax (15%): $7,500
- NIIT (3.8% on $50,000): $1,900
- Total tax: $9,400

State Taxes:
Most states tax capital gains as ordinary income:
- California: Up to 13.3%
- New York: Up to 10.9%
- Texas, Florida, Nevada, Washington: 0% (no state income tax)

Check your state's rules for capital gains treatment.

=== DOCUMENT 2: Bonds, Treasury Securities, and Fixed Income Investing ===
TITLE: Bond Investing and Interest Income Taxation
SOURCE: IRS Publication 550, TreasuryDirect.gov
CATEGORY: tax

Bonds are debt securities where you lend money to government or corporations in exchange for periodic interest payments and return of principal at maturity.

Types of Bonds:
1. U.S. Treasury Securities
   - T-Bills (short-term, <1 year)
   - T-Notes (medium-term, 2-10 years)
   - T-Bonds (long-term, 20-30 years)
   - TIPS (inflation-protected)
   - I Bonds (savings bonds, inflation-adjusted)

2. Municipal Bonds (Munis)
   - Issued by state/local governments
   - Interest usually federal tax-exempt

3. Corporate Bonds
   - Issued by companies
   - Higher yields, higher risk than government bonds

4. Agency Bonds
   - Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.
   - Backed by government agencies

Interest Income Taxation:
U.S. Treasury Securities:
- Interest is federal taxable income
- EXEMPT from state and local taxes
- Report on Form 1040, Schedule B (if over $1,500)

Municipal Bonds:
- Interest EXEMPT from federal income tax
- May be exempt from state tax if you live in issuing state
- "Triple tax-free" if federal + state + local exempt
- Private activity bonds may trigger Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

Corporate Bonds:
- Interest fully taxable (federal and state)
- Report on Form 1040, Schedule B

Example:
$10,000 invested in 5% bonds:
- Treasury bond: $500 interest (federal taxable, state exempt)
- Municipal bond: $400 interest (federal exempt, often state exempt)
- Corporate bond: $500 interest (federal and state taxable)

If in 24% federal bracket, 6% state bracket:
- Treasury: $500 - $120 (federal) = $380 after tax
- Municipal: $500 (no tax) = $500 after tax (best despite lower rate!)
- Corporate: $500 - $120 (federal) - $30 (state) = $350 after tax

Tax-Equivalent Yield:
Formula: Tax-Exempt Yield ÷ (1 - Tax Rate)

Example:
4% municipal bond
You're in 24% federal + 6% state = 30% total tax bracket
Tax-equivalent yield: 4% ÷ (1 - 0.30) = 5.71%

This means a 4% muni bond is equivalent to a 5.71% taxable bond for you.

U.S. Savings Bonds (Series EE and I Bonds):
Series EE Bonds:
- Earn fixed interest rate
- Interest compounds semiannually
- Tax-deferred until redemption or maturity (30 years)
- Can elect to report interest annually (rarely done)
- Purchase limit: $10,000 per person per year (electronic)

Series I Bonds:
- Interest rate = fixed rate + inflation rate (adjusted every 6 months)
- Purchase limit: $10,000 electronic + $5,000 paper (via tax refund)
- Cannot be redeemed first 12 months
- 3-month interest penalty if redeemed before 5 years
- Tax-deferred like EE bonds

Education Tax Exclusion:
Savings bond interest may be tax-free if used for qualified education expenses:
- Must be Series EE or I bonds issued after 1989
- Must be purchased after age 24
- Income limits apply (2024: phase-out $100,800-$130,800 single, $167,800-$197,800 married)
- Must use for tuition/fees (not room/board)
- Report on Form 8815

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS):
TIPS adjust principal for inflation:
- Interest rate fixed, but paid on adjusted principal
- Principal increases with CPI (inflation)
- At maturity, receive higher of adjusted or original principal

Tax Treatment:
- Interest payments: Taxable when received
- Principal adjustments (inflation): Taxable annually (even though not received until maturity)
- This creates "phantom income" - you owe tax on money you haven't received yet

Example:
$10,000 TIPS, 2% interest rate
Inflation: 3% in year 1
- Principal adjusts to $10,300
- Interest payment: $206 (2% of $10,300)
- Taxable income: $206 (interest) + $300 (principal adjustment) = $506

Best held in retirement accounts to defer phantom income tax.

Bond Sales Before Maturity:
If you sell bonds before maturity:
- Calculate capital gain/loss (sale price - cost basis)
- Short-term (<1 year) or long-term (>1 year) treatment
- Report on Form 8949 and Schedule D

Example:
Bought corporate bond for $10,000
Sold after 18 months for $10,500
- Long-term capital gain: $500
- Taxed at preferential rates (0%, 15%, 20%)

Bond Premium Amortization:
If you buy a bond for MORE than face value (at premium):
- You can elect to amortize the premium (reduce it each year)
- Reduces your taxable interest income
- Adjusts cost basis downward
- Use Form 8815 to make election

Example:
Buy $10,000 face value bond for $11,000 (premium of $1,000)
Bond pays 5% interest = $500/year
Maturity: 10 years
Annual premium amortization: $100

Each year:
- Interest received: $500
- Minus amortization: $100
- Taxable interest: $400

At maturity:
- Receive $10,000 face value
- Cost basis adjusted to $10,000
- No capital loss

Bond Discount:
If you buy bonds for LESS than face value:
- Original Issue Discount (OID): Built-in interest, taxable annually
- Market Discount: Gain when redeemed or sold

OID Reporting:
- Brokerage provides Form 1099-OID showing taxable amount
- Report on Form 1040, Schedule B
- Increases your cost basis

Zero-Coupon Bonds:
Bonds that pay no periodic interest:
- Sold at deep discount
- Entire gain at maturity
- OID rules apply - must report "phantom income" annually
- Best held in tax-deferred retirement accounts

Example:
Buy zero-coupon bond for $6,000
Matures in 10 years for $10,000
- Each year, you owe tax on imputed interest (even though not paid)
- Basis increases each year
- At maturity, no additional taxable gain (already taxed)

Municipal Bond Funds:
Mutual funds or ETFs investing in municipal bonds:
- Dividends generally federal tax-exempt
- Some portion may be taxable (fund reports breakdown)
- Capital gains distributions: Taxable
- Gains from selling fund shares: Taxable

Where to Buy Bonds:
- TreasuryDirect.gov (direct purchase of U.S. Treasury securities)
- Brokerage accounts (Fidelity, Schwab, etc.)
- Bond mutual funds / ETFs
- Directly from issuers (some municipal bonds)

Bond Laddering Strategy:
Purchase bonds with staggered maturity dates:
- Year 1: $10,000 bond
- Year 2: $10,000 bond
- Year 3: $10,000 bond
- etc.

Benefits:
- Regular income as bonds mature
- Reduce interest rate risk
- Flexibility to reinvest at prevailing rates

Interest Reporting:
Form 1099-INT:
- Box 1: Interest income (taxable)
- Box 3: Interest on U.S. Savings Bonds and Treasury obligations
- Box 8: Tax-exempt interest (municipal bonds)

Report on:
- Schedule B if over $1,500 total interest
- Form 1040, line 2b (taxable interest)
- Form 1040, line 2a (tax-exempt interest - informational, not taxed)

=== DOCUMENT 3: Mutual Funds and ETF Taxation ===
TITLE: Tax Treatment of Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds
SOURCE: IRS Publication 550
CATEGORY: tax

Mutual funds and ETFs pool money from many investors to buy diversified portfolios of stocks, bonds, or other assets.

Mutual Funds vs. ETFs:
Mutual Funds:
- Priced once daily (end of day NAV)
- Bought/sold directly with fund company
- Minimum investments often required
- May have load fees (sales charges)

ETFs:
- Trade like stocks throughout the day
- Bought/sold on stock exchanges
- No minimum investment (buy 1 share)
- Generally lower fees than mutual funds
- More tax-efficient (in-kind creation/redemption)

Tax Events for Fund Investors:
1. Dividend distributions - taxable when received
2. Capital gain distributions - taxable when received (even if reinvested)
3. Selling fund shares - capital gain/loss

Dividend Distributions:
Funds pass through income to shareholders:
- Ordinary dividends: Taxed at ordinary rates (10%-37%)
- Qualified dividends: Taxed at capital gains rates (0%, 15%, 20%)
- Reported on Form 1099-DIV

Example:
Mutual fund owns Apple, Microsoft, Google stock
These companies pay dividends to fund
Fund distributes dividends to you
- Taxable in year received
- Even if you reinvest (buy more shares)

Capital Gain Distributions:
When fund sells stocks at profit:
- Fund distributes gains to shareholders (usually December)
- Short-term capital gain distributions: Taxed as ordinary income
- Long-term capital gain distributions: Taxed at preferential rates
- Reported on Form 1099-DIV

Important: You owe tax on these gains even if:
- You didn't sell any fund shares
- You reinvested the distributions
- Your fund share price went down

This is a common "surprise" tax bill for new investors.

Reinvested Distributions:
If you reinvest dividends/capital gains:
- Still taxable in year received
- INCREASES your cost basis (important!)

Example:
Bought fund shares for $10,000 (1,000 shares at $10)
Received $500 dividend (reinvested to buy 50 more shares)
- Taxable income: $500
- Now own 1,050 shares
- Cost basis: $10,500 ($10,000 original + $500 reinvested)

When you sell:
If you sell all 1,050 shares for $11,000
- Gain: $11,000 - $10,500 = $500 (NOT $1,000)

Failing to track reinvestments = overpaying taxes!

Selling Fund Shares:
Report on Form 8949 and Schedule D:
- Date acquired
- Date sold
- Proceeds
- Cost basis
- Gain or loss

Cost Basis Methods for Mutual Funds:
1. Average Cost (default for mutual funds)
   - Average price of all shares owned
   - Single-category: Simple average
   - Double-category: Separate short-term and long-term averages

2. Specific Identification
   - Choose which shares to sell
   - Must notify fund BEFORE sale
   - Best for tax optimization

3. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
   - Sell oldest shares first

Example - Average Cost:
Bought 100 shares at $10 = $1,000
Bought 100 shares at $15 = $1,500
Total: 200 shares, $2,500 invested
Average cost: $12.50/share

Sell 50 shares at $20:
- Proceeds: $1,000
- Cost basis: 50 × $12.50 = $625
- Gain: $375

Example - Specific Identification:
Sell the 50 shares purchased at $15:
- Proceeds: $1,000
- Cost basis: 50 × $15 = $750
- Gain: $250 (lower tax!)

Tax Efficiency: ETFs vs. Mutual Funds:
ETFs are generally MORE tax-efficient:
- Fewer capital gain distributions (often $0)
- In-kind redemption mechanism avoids realizing gains
- Lower turnover
- You only pay taxes when YOU sell shares

Mutual funds:
- Actively managed funds often have high turnover
- Generate more capital gain distributions
- Less control over tax timing

Index Funds:
Whether mutual fund or ETF, index funds are tax-efficient:
- Low turnover (only rebalance when index changes)
- Fewer capital gain distributions
- Lower fees

Tax-Managed Funds:
Some funds specifically minimize taxes:
- Avoid short-term gains
- Harvest losses to offset gains
- Defer realizing gains when possible

Bond Funds:
Interest income passed through to investors:
- Taxable if corporate/Treasury bond fund
- Tax-exempt if municipal bond fund
- Reported monthly or quarterly

Tax-Exempt Bond Funds:
Dividends usually federal tax-exempt:
- Still must report on Form 1040, line 2a (informational)
- May trigger AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax)
- State tax treatment varies

Form 1099-DIV Breakdown:
Box 1a: Total ordinary dividends
Box 1b: Qualified dividends (subset of 1a, taxed favorably)
Box 2a: Total capital gain distributions
Box 2b: Section 1250 gain (unrecaptured gains, 25% rate)
Box 2c: Section 1202 gain (qualified small business stock)
Box 2d: Collectibles gain (28% rate)
Box 11: Exempt-interest dividends (municipal bond funds)

Foreign Tax Paid:
If fund invests internationally:
- May pay foreign taxes on dividends
- You can claim Foreign Tax Credit
- Reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 7
- File Form 1116 to claim credit

Year-End Tax Planning:
Avoid buying mutual funds in late December:
- Funds distribute capital gains in December
- If you buy before distribution, you owe tax immediately
- Wait until after distribution to avoid "buying a tax bill"

Example:
Fund price $50/share on Dec 1
Dec 15: Fund distributes $5/share capital gain
New fund price: $45/share

If you bought Dec 1:
- Paid $50/share
- Received $5 distribution (taxable)
- Now worth $45
- Result: Owe tax on $5 but have $5 loss!

Better: Wait until Dec 16, buy at $45, avoid tax.

Target-Date Retirement Funds:
"Set and forget" funds that adjust allocation over time:
- 2050 Target Fund (for someone retiring in 2050)
- Automatically becomes more conservative as target date approaches
- Tax treatment same as regular mutual funds
- Best held in retirement accounts (401k, IRA)

Retirement Account Considerations:
Funds in 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA:
- NO tax on dividends or capital gains while in account
- Traditional: Withdrawals taxed as ordinary income
- Roth: Qualified withdrawals tax-free
- No Form 1099-DIV issued

Best Location Strategy:
Taxable accounts:
- Tax-efficient index funds / ETFs
- Municipal bond funds (if high tax bracket)

Retirement accounts:
- Actively managed funds (high turnover)
- Taxable bond funds
- REITs (real estate investment trusts)

Wash Sale Rule:
Applies to mutual funds and ETFs:
- Sell fund at loss
- Buy "substantially identical" fund within 30 days
- Loss disallowed

"Substantially identical" is tricky:
- Selling Vanguard S&P 500 fund, buying Fidelity S&P 500 fund: Likely substantially identical
- Selling S&P 500 fund, buying Total Stock Market fund: Probably NOT substantially identical

State Taxation:
Most states tax fund dividends and capital gains as ordinary income:
- No preferential rates for long-term gains
- Municipal bond fund dividends may be state tax-exempt (if in-state bonds)

Record Keeping:
Keep ALL statements showing:
- Purchase confirmations
- Dividend reinvestment records
- Capital gain distributions
- Year-end cost basis reports

Brokerage provides cost basis for shares purchased after 2012, but YOU are responsible for earlier purchases.
