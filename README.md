## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** - JavaScript runtime
- **Python 3.9+** - Backend runtime
- **Supabase Account** - For database and vector storage
- **Groq API Key** - For LLM inference
- **Hugging Face Token** - For embeddings API

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rshriharripriya/concierge-ai.git
   cd concierge-ai
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # For Production/Vercel (Lightweight):
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # For Local Dev & Eval (Includes Ragas/LangChain):
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create `.env.local` in the project root:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   
   # AI Service Keys
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   
   # API Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=/api/py
   ```
   
   **Where to get these keys:**
   - **Supabase**: Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → Create project → Settings → API
   - **Groq**: Get free API key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

## 🎯 Core Features Explained

### Semantic Routing Engine
The semantic router analyzes natural language queries to determine the best handling path. It evaluates:
- **Intent classification** (Simple Tax, Complex Tax, Investment, etc.)
- **Complexity scoring** (1-5 scale based on query difficulty)
- **Confidence levels** (How certain the system is about classification)
- **Routing decisions** (AI vs Human expert)

### RAG-Powered AI Responses
When a query routes to the AI agent:
1. Query is converted to embeddings using Sentence Transformers
2. Vector similarity search finds the most relevant tax documents
3. Retrieved context is sent to Groq Llama 3 for response generation
4. AI synthesizes an answer grounded in actual tax documentation
5. Response includes source citations for transparency

### Expert Matching Algorithm
For complex queries that need human expertise:
1. Query embeddings are compared against expert skill profiles
2. Semantic similarity scores determine best expert matches
3. Availability and match confidence are factored in
4. User sees expert profile with bio and specialization
5. Seamless handoff to human expert occurs
